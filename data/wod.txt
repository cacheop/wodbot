We've been putting the warm-up into the workouts so that everyone understands the importance of properly preparing for the work ahead. In doing this we have to sacrifice class time or class runs long. The idea here is for you all to take responsibility for your own bodies and warm up appropriately. SO.... today, and moving forward, the warm-up is written for you but it will NOT be a part of the class. Please try to get in and do it on your own before class begins. If not, the coaches have been instructed to move forward with class while you complete the warm-up. You may then jump in wherever the class has progressed to ; 3 mins Z1 .

Fight Gone Bad! ; This is our famous ?Fight Gone Bad? workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute.

The stations are: ; Wall-ball ? 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps) Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps) Box Jump ? 20? box (Reps) Push-press 75 pounds (Reps) Row ? calories (Calories) ; The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of ?rotate?, the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point. ; Add your points and post them to comments. ; 0 .

Diane ; 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups ; This is 3 rounds ; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management (work/rest timing to optimize time) is an essential skill. ; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane." ; Post time and any needed modifications to comments. ; Compare your time to 050201 .

Fight Gone Bad! ; This is our famous "Fight Gone Bad" workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We've used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are: ; Wall-ball - 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps) Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps) Box Jump - 20" box (Reps) Push-press 75 pounds (Reps) Row (Calories) ; The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of "rotate," the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point. ; Add your points and post them to comments. 405 is the score to beat .

Tabata "Bottom to Bottom" Squat Run 1 mile ; Clock starts for run on rising from last squat. ; The Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the "normal" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don't seem as short with this protocol! ; Post Tabata score and mile time to comments .

Diane ; 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups ; This is 3 rounds ; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. ; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.

Diane ; For time: 21-15- and 9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand Push-ups ; This is 3 rounds ; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. ; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane.". ; 03 .

**"Diane" ** ; 21-15-9 reps of: Deadlift 225 Handstand push-ups ; This is 3 rounds ; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a "mini-Diane" at 15-12-9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. ; If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be "your Diane." ; Post time and any needed modifications to comments .
